## My process

With the HTML basic content provided, worked on:
  - assigning CSS class names using the BEM method
  - used SASS (7-1 file structure, I only needed to use 4 modular folders in tis project)
  - creating variables in SASS for color schemes, fonts, font-sizes, etc
  - adding Google Fonts provided
  - reset CSS to give all browsers a common starting point

Next worked on:
  - building mobile first
  - Figuring out where to use Flex vs Grid (used both)
  - Worked on media query for smaller-mobile/tablet/desktop

Finally worked on:
  - Worked on accessibility features for the accordion and footer links

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Using Sass more and more has been great.  I've been really learning how to write as little code possible by using Sass.  It's very gratifying when I can see where I would have had to write more if I wrote in just CSS.

Working on the accordion was fun.  I really showed the power of CSS/Sass alone.  I found a video online where someone created a different accordion and went from there.  It wasn't too hard really.

### Continued development

I had some trouble with getting the svg's to hide at the borders of the card.  As of now I'm seeking help with that from the Frontend Mentor community on Slack.  When you are reading this hopefully it is fixed.  Other then that this was a very rewarding project.
